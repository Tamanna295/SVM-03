# SVM-03
This repository is used to implement support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the kaggle datasets. 

Project Steps:

Data Analysis: Explore and understand patterns within the Kaggle dataset containing cat and dog images. Data Preprocessing: Perform essential preprocessing tasks, including image resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting for training and testing. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the images to serve as input for the SVM model. Model Implementation: Design and train an SVM model specifically for image classification, utilizing the selected features. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using separate test data. Assess key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-Tuning: Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVM model for better classification results. Key Takeaways:

Image Classification: Gain practical experience in creating image classification models using machine learning techniques. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Understand how SVMs efficiently perform binary classification tasks. Data Preprocessing: Enhance skills in preparing image data for machine learning, including resizing and normalization. Model Evaluation: Learn to interpret evaluation metrics for image classification tasks. Kaggle Dataset: Gain insights into real-world data challenges and best practices when constructing datasets. This project was completed during a machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech.
